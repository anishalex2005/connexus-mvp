# Architecture Diagrams

How to regenerate images from Mermaid sources (requires `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`):

```bash
# From project root
mmdc -i docs/architecture/diagrams/system-overview.mermaid -o docs/architecture/diagrams/system-overview.png
mmdc -i docs/architecture/diagrams/call-flow.mermaid -o docs/architecture/diagrams/call-flow.png
mmdc -i docs/architecture/diagrams/sms-flow.mermaid -o docs/architecture/diagrams/sms-flow.png
mmdc -i docs/architecture/diagrams/ai-interaction-flow.mermaid -o docs/architecture/diagrams/ai-interaction-flow.png
```
